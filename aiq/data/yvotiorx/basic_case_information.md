# Case Title  
QuantumTech v. NovaSynth: High-Tech Partnership Dispute  

---

# Parties Involved  
- **QuantumTech Ltd.** (based in Auroria)  
- **NovaSynth Industries** (based in Virelia)  

---

# Background  
QuantumTech and NovaSynth formed a joint venture in 2021 to co-develop advanced smart grid technology for renewable energy systems. The partnership was governed by a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA), which outlined profit-sharing terms, intellectual property (IP) rights, and mutual obligations. Disputes arose over R&D cost allocation, IP ownership, and NovaSynth’s collaboration with third parties without QuantumTech’s consent.  

---

# General Facts  
QuantumTech alleges violations of the JVA, including unauthorized use of its proprietary algorithms in a competing product, withholding 30% of profits from a smart grid project, and collaborating with a rival firm (Aether Systems) without approval. NovaSynth disputes these claims, asserting that QuantumTech failed to meet R&D contribution targets, its IP was independently developed, and the Aether Systems collaboration was disclosed and approved by QuantumTech. Both parties seek mediation to resolve financial disputes, clarify IP ownership, and determine whether the partnership should continue or be dissolved.
