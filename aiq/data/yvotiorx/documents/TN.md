### **2. Notice of Termination**

#### **a) Unauthorized Use of Proprietary Algorithms**  
QuantumTech has allegedly incorporated NovaSynth’s proprietary algorithms into a competing product without authorization or consent under Article 5 of the JVA.

#### **b) Withholding Profits from Shared Projects**  
QuantumTech has failed to remit 30% of profits from the [Insert Project Name] smart grid project as stipulated in Article 4 of the JVA. This withholding represents a material breach of the profit-sharing obligations agreed upon by both parties.  

#### **c) Unauthorized Collaboration with Third Parties**  
QuantumTech’s collaboration with Aether Systems, a rival firm, without prior approval under Article 6 of the JVA, has compromised the integrity of the joint venture. NovaSynth asserts that this action was neither disclosed nor sanctioned, violating the terms of mutual exclusivity and confidentiality outlined in the JVA.

NovaSynth hereby demands mediation under Article 10 of the JVA to resolve outstanding financial disputes, clarify IP ownership, and determine the future of the partnership.  

**Mediation Terms:**

### **4. Consequences of Non-Compliance**
