### **6.2 Third-Party Collaboration**  
The Licensee must obtain prior written approval from the Licensor before engaging third parties (e.g., Aether Systems) for collaboration or joint development involving the IP.  

---

## **7. Dispute Resolution**  
### **7.1 Mediation**  
All disputes arising under this agreement shall first be submitted to **mediation** by a neutral third-party appointed jointly by both parties. If mediation fails, the matter may proceed to arbitration in accordance with the rules of the [insert arbitration institution].

## **Exhibit A: List of Licensed Algorithms**  
| Algorithm Name | Description | Purpose |  
|----------------|-------------|---------|  
| GridOpt-3.2    | Smart grid optimization algorithm | Enhances energy distribution efficiency |  
| SecureSync-1.0 | Data synchronization protocol | Ensures real-time communication between nodes |  

---

## **Exhibit B: Royalty Calculation Example**  
**Quarterly Revenue:** $500,000 USD  
**Exchange Rate (AUR/USD):** 2.5  
**Royalty Payment (AUR):** $1,250,000 × 15% = **$187,500 AUR**

### **Key Legal Considerations for Competition:**  
- **Exclusive vs. Non-Exclusive Licensing:** The IPA’s non-exclusive nature could allow NovaSynth to collaborate with third parties, potentially conflicting with QuantumTech’s claims of unauthorized use.  
- **Royalty Structure:** A 15% royalty rate may be contested if deemed unfair or if the Licensee argues for a lower percentage.  
- **Termination Clauses:** The 30-day notice period could be pivotal in resolving disputes over IP misuse.  
- **Third-Party Collaboration Requirements:** This clause directly addresses NovaSynth’s alleged collaboration with Aether Systems, providing a basis for legal action if violated.
