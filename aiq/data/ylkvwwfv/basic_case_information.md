- **Virex counters** that NovaTech delivered subpar quality components, resulting in defective products and reputational harm, and withheld critical technical support during a key production phase.  
- Both parties assert that the original contract contained ambiguously worded terms, creating misinterpretations of responsibilities and obligations.
