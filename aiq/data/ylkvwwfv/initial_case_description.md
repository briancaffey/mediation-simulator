## **Background Information**  
NovaTech Industries Ltd. and Virex Manufacturing Corp. entered into a supply agreement in 2023, where NovaTech agreed to supply high-performance electronic components to Virex for use in their consumer electronics products. The partnership was initially successful, with both parties reporting strong growth in sales. However, tensions arose in early 2025 due to disputes over delivery timelines, product quality, and financial terms.

## **Case Description**  
NovaTech alleges that Virex failed to meet agreed-upon payment deadlines, causing significant cash flow issues for their operations. Additionally, NovaTech claims that Virex repeatedly requested last-minute modifications to the components, leading to production delays and increased costs.  

Virex counters that NovaTech delivered subpar quality components, resulting in defective products and reputational damage. They also assert that NovaTech withheld critical technical support during a critical production phase, forcing Virex to invest heavily in alternative solutions. Both parties claim the original contract was ambiguously worded, leaving room for misinterpretation of responsibilities and obligations.
