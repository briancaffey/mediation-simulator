# Background  
NovaTech Solutions and Aether Industries entered a multi-year supply agreement in 2021 to provide advanced semiconductor components for NovaTech’s manufacturing operations. The contract included guaranteed delivery timelines, quality assurances, and financial terms. Over two years, repeated delays by Aether led to production bottlenecks at NovaTech. Both parties attempted negotiations but failed to resolve disputes over contractual obligations and payment responsibilities.
