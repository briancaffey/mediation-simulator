# **Case Name**  
**Cross-Border Supply Chain Dispute Between NovaTech Industries and Zenith Manufacturing Co.**

---

## **Requesting and Responding Parties**  

### **Parties Involved**  
- **Requesting Party**: *NovaTech Industries* (based in the fictional country of **Auroria**)  
  - **Representative**: *Kaelen Voss*, Chief Financial Officer (CFO)  
- **Responding Party**: *Zenith Manufacturing Co.* (based in the fictional country of **Virelia**)  
  - **Representative**: *Nia Rho*, Director of Supply Chains  

### **Background Information**  
NovaTech Industries and Zenith Manufacturing Co. entered a supply agreement in 2021 to provide high-performance semiconductor components for Zenith’s industrial automation systems. The partnership was initially successful, with NovaTech delivering on-time shipments and Zenith paying promptly. However, tensions arose over recent delays, quality disputes, and payment disagreements, leading to a breakdown in communication and operational inefficiencies.

## **Case Description**  
NovaTech Industries alleges that Zenith Manufacturing Co. has violated the terms of their supply contract by:  
1. Delays in payment for shipments delivered in Q2 2023, resulting in cash flow issues for NovaTech.  
2. Refusing to accept certain batches of components due to alleged quality defects, despite NovaTech’s adherence to agreed specifications.  
3. Withholding critical technical data required for component integration, causing production bottlenecks at Zenith.  

Zenith Manufacturing Co., on the other hand, claims that:  
1. NovaTech delivered substandard components in late 2022, leading to defective products and reputational harm.  
2. NovaTech failed to meet delivery deadlines for critical orders in Q1 2023, disrupting Zenith’s production schedule.  
3. Nova,tech’s invoicing practices were inconsistent, creating disputes over payment amounts and timing.  

Both parties seek mediation to resolve financial compensation, contract amendments, and operational cooperation.

## **Confidential Facts for Each Party**  

### **Confidential Facts for the Requesting Party (NovaTech Industries)**  
- **Production Delays**: A severe natural disaster in Auroria disrupted NovaTech’s semiconductor production in early 2023, leading to unplanned shipment delays.  
- **Quality Assurance Compliance**: NovaTech provided third-party certifications proving all delivered components met Virelian technical standards.  
- **Payment Dispute**: Zenith withheld payments for invoices dated January–March 2023, citing “quality concerns,” despite NovaTech’s documentation of compliance.  
- **Negotiation Attempts**: NovaTech proposed revised payment terms (e.g., 50% upfront) to mitigate cash flow risks, which Zenith rejected.  

### **Confidential Facts for the Responding Party (Zenith Manufacturing Co.)**  
- **Component Defects**: A batch of NovaTech components delivered in February 2022 caused a critical system failure in one of Zenith’s flagship products, resulting in a $2M loss.  
- **Delivery Delays**: NovaTech missed three key delivery deadlines in Q1 2023, forcing Zenith to source replacements at higher costs.  
- **Spec Misalignment**: NovaTech failed to adhere to updated technical specifications agreed upon in late 2022, leading to integration issues.  
- **Financial Strain**: Zenith’s recent merger with a smaller competitor caused liquidity constraints, contributing to delayed payments for NovaTech invoices.
