## **Background Information**  
HelioTech Innovations Ltd. and Nova Energy Solutions Corp. were partners in a joint venture to develop advanced solar panel technology for renewable energy markets. The partnership began in 2021 under the "Solar Nexus Initiative," with HelioTech providing proprietary photovoltaic cell designs, while Nova contributed manufacturing infrastructure and distribution networks. Their collaboration was governed by a licensing agreement that granted Nova non-exclusive rights to use HelioTech’s patented solar technology for commercial production. However, tensions arose in 2023 when HelioTech alleged unauthorized use of its intellectual property (IP) by Nova, leading to disputes over royalty payments, IP ownership, and breach of contract terms.

## **Case Description**  
HelioTech Innovations Ltd. alleges that Nova Energy Solutions Corp. violated the terms of their 2021 licensing agreement by:  
1. Manufacturing solar panels using HelioTech’s patented photovoltaic cell design without proper royalty payments.  
2. Incorporating HelioTech’s proprietary technology into a new product line, "NovaSolar X-3," which has flooded the Lumina Republic market.  
3. Failing to disclose their plans to expand production beyond the agreed-upon capacity, causing harm to HelioTech’s competitive position.  

Nova Energy Solutions Corp. denies these claims, asserting that:  
1. Their solar technology was independently developed using open-source research and third-party components, not HelioTech’s IP.  
2. The "NovaSolar X-3" product line complies with all terms of the licensing agreement, including royalty payments for 2022–2023.  
3. HelioTech’s allegations are motivated by a desire to stifle competition and secure market dominance in Lumina Republic.  

The dispute has escalated into a legal battle over IP ownership, contractual obligations, and potential damages.

## **Confidential Facts for the Requesting Party (HelioTech Innovations Ltd.)**  
- HelioTech’s photovoltaic cell design is protected by a patent filed in 2019, which has been upheld in Lumina Republic courts.  
- Nova’s "NovaSolar X-3" product line includes components that match HelioTech’s patented design in terms of efficiency metrics and material composition.  
- Financial records show Nova underpaid royalties by approximately L5 million between 2022–2023, which HelioTech claims is a direct result of IP misuse.  
- Internal communications reveal Nova executives expressed interest in "reverse-engineering" HelioTech’s technology to reduce production costs.

## **Confidential Facts for the Responding Party (Nova Energy Solutions Corp.)**  
- Nova developed its solar technology independently using open-source research and third-party suppliers, with no reliance on HelioTech’s IP.  
- The "NovaSolar X-3" product line was designed in 2022 using proprietary algorithms and materials not disclosed to HelioTech until after the licensing agreement expired.  
- Nova has paid all outstanding royalties for the 2022–2023 fiscal year, including a L4 million payment in May 2023.  
- Internal documents show Nova’s R&D team conducted prior art searches that confirmed the absence of HelioTech’s technology in public databases before product development began.
