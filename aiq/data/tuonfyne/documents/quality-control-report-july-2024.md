**Document Type**: Inspection Report  
**Prepared By**: NovaTech Solutions Ltd. Internal Quality Assurance Department  
**Date of Report**: July 15, 2024  

---

## **Executive Summary**  
This report outlines the findings of NovaTech Solutions Ltd.’s internal quality control inspection of components supplied by Aurora Manufacturing Co. under their supply contract (dated April 2021). The inspection was conducted in response to repeated delivery delays and quality concerns raised during production cycles from January to June 2024.  

Key findings include:  
- **Defect Rate**: 18.7% of components failed to meet NovaTech’s quality standards, exceeding the contractual threshold of 5%.  
- **Rework Costs**: Estimated rework expenses amount to **$2.3 million**, directly tied to Aurora’s non-compliant deliveries.  
- **Root Causes**: Defects stem from inconsistent material specifications, inadequate testing protocols, and delayed communication from Aurora.  

This report serves as critical evidence in NovaTech’s claim of breach of contract under the terms of the supply agreement (Article 4.3 on quality assurance).

## **2. Defect Analysis**  
### **2.1 Defect Categories**  
| **Defect Type**               | **Frequency (%)** | **Impact on Production**                |  
|------------------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|  
| Electrical Short Circuits     | 6.3%              | Immediate system shutdowns, safety risks |  
| Material Inconsistencies      | 5.8%              | Reduced durability, increased rework    |  
| Dimensional Tolerances Exceeded | 4.2%         | Assembly failures, rejected batches     |  
| Surface Contamination          | 2.4%              | Risk of corrosion, long-term reliability issues |  
| **Total Defect Rate**         | **18.7%**         |                                         |  

### **2.2 Non-Compliance with Contractual Specifications**  
- **Material Specifications**: Aurora’s components failed to meet the minimum conductivity threshold (≥ 500 µS/cm) specified in the contract.  
- **Testing Protocols**: Missing third-party certification for thermal stability testing (per Article 4.3.2).  
- **Documentation Gaps**: Incomplete traceability records for raw materials, hindering root cause analysis.

## **3. Rework and Cost Implications**  
### **3.1 Rework Activities**  
- **Scope**: Replacing defective components, recalibrating systems, and retesting units to meet quality standards.  
- **Affected Systems**: 68% of NovaTech’s smart manufacturing lines (totaling 12 production facilities).  

### **3.2 Estimated Costs**  
| **Cost Category**            | **Estimated Cost** |  
|-----------------------------|--------------------|  
| Component Replacement        | $1,450,000         |  
| Labor for Rework            | $600,000           |  
| System Downtime (Lost Revenue) | $2.3 million    |  
| **Total**                   | **$4.35 million**  |  

### **3.3 Impact on Operations**  
- Delays in production schedules: 14 out of 20 scheduled batches were delayed by ≥ 7 days.  
- Increased maintenance costs for damaged equipment due to substandard components.
