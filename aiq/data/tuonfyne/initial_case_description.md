## **Background Information**  
NovaTech Solutions Ltd. and Aurora Manufacturing Co. entered into a supply contract in 2021, with Aurora providing specialized circuit boards to NovaTech for use in their smart manufacturing systems. The relationship was initially successful, but tensions arose after Aurora failed to deliver critical components on time in late 2023, leading to production delays and financial losses for NovaTech. Aurora claims that supply chain disruptions in Nebula caused the delay, while NovaTech alleges poor contract management and intentional non-compliance with quality standards.

---

## **Case Description**  
In early 2024, NovaTech filed a dispute against Aurora, alleging breach of contract due to:  
1. **Delivery Delays**: Aurora missed multiple delivery deadlines, causing NovaTech to halt production for over six weeks.  
2. **Quality Issues**: Several batches of components failed quality control tests, requiring costly rework.  
3. **Lack of Transparency**: Aurora did not disclose supply chain risks or alternative sourcing options.  

Aurora counters that:  
1. **Force Majeure Events**: A natural disaster in Nebula disrupted their logistics network, making timely delivery impossible.  
2. **NovaTech’s Reliance on Subpar Alternatives**: NovaTech sourced components from unverified third parties during delays, leading to quality degradation.  
3. **Negotiation Deadlock**: NovaTech refused to renegotiate contract terms despite Aurora’s attempts to adjust pricing and delivery schedules.  

Both parties seek mediation to resolve financial compensation, contractual obligations, and future collaboration terms.

## **Confidential Facts for Each Party**  

### **Confidential Facts for the Requesting Party (NovaTech Solutions Ltd.)**  
- **Penalty Clause Misinterpretation**: The contract included a clause allowing NovaTech to terminate the agreement if deliveries were delayed beyond 10% of the scheduled timeframe. However, Aurora’s delays exceeded this threshold, and NovaTech believes the clause was ambiguously worded.  
- **Hidden Costs of Delays**: NovaTech incurred $2.3 million in lost revenue due to production halts, which Aurora failed to account for in their initial dispute response.  
- **Third-Party Sourcing Compromise**: When Aurora delayed shipments, NovaTech had to source components from an unverified supplier in Virelia, resulting in a 15% increase in production costs.  
- **Escalation Timeline**: NovaTech escalated the issue internally after three consecutive failed deliveries, but Aurora’s team ignored their formal notice of breach.

### **Confidential Facts for the Responding Party (Aurora Manufacturing Co.)**  
- **Supply Chain Collapse**: A severe storm in Nebula’s northern region disrupted 70% of Aurora’s logistics infrastructure in October 2023, preventing timely shipments to NovaTech.  
- **Negotiation Resistance**: Aurora proposed a revised contract with adjusted delivery dates and compensation for delays, but NovaTech rejected it without discussion, citing “unacceptable terms.”  
- **Quality Assurance Failures**: Aurora claims that two batches of components failed due to a third-party vendor’s defective raw materials, which were not disclosed during the sourcing process.  
- **Financial Strain**: Aurora incurred $1.8 million in additional costs to repair their logistics network and meet minimum delivery requirements for NovaTech, but these expenses were not addressed in the dispute resolution process.

## **Case Summary for Mediation**  
This case centers on a high-stakes international supply chain conflict with clear financial and operational implications. The parties must resolve disputes over contractual obligations, force majeure claims, and the impact of delays on both businesses. Key questions include:  
- Was Aurora’s delay attributable to unavoidable events or poor contract management?  
- Can NovaTech claim compensation for losses caused by third-party sourcing decisions?  
- Are there viable terms for resuming collaboration post-dispute?  

The case is designed to test mediation skills in balancing contractual fidelity, equitable compensation, and long-term business relationships.
