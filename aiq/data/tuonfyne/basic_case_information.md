# Background  
NovaTech Solutions Ltd. and Aurora Manufacturing Co. entered into a supply contract in 2021 for the provision of specialized circuit boards to NovaTech’s smart manufacturing systems. The relationship faced tension due to Aurora’s failure to deliver critical components on time in late 2023, resulting in production delays and financial losses for NovaTech. Aurora attributed the delay to supply chain disruptions in Nebula, while NovaTech alleged poor contract management and intentional non-compliance with quality standards.

- **Aurora’s Counterclaims**: Aurora asserts force majeure events (natural disasters in Nebula) caused logistics disruptions, claims NovaTech sourced subpar components during delays, and states NovaTech refused to renegotiate terms.  
- **Mediation Request**: Both parties seek mediation to resolve financial compensation, contractual obligations, and future collaboration terms.  
- **Key Documents**: The original supply contract, email correspondence discussing delays, and NovaTech’s quality control report are central to the dispute.
