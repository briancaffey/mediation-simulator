### **Key Legal Points for Competition Analysis**  
- **Interpretation of "Defect Liability"**: Does NovaTech’s obligation to replace defective goods extend to indirect damages (e.g., production halts)?  
- **Mediation vs. Litigation**: Is the mediation clause enforceable, and what remedies are available if ZenCorp refuses to participate?  
- **Payment Dispute Framework**: How does the 1.5% interest rate align with Virelia’s statutory interest limits?  
- **Force Majeure Scope**: Could a global supply chain disruption (e.g., pandemics) qualify as Force Majeure, absolving either party of liability?  

This document provides a robust foundation for legal analysis in the competition, emphasizing contractual terms and their practical implications.
