# Background  
NovaTech Solutions and ZenCorp Industries entered a partnership in 2021 to supply advanced microprocessors for ZenCorp’s consumer electronics. The agreement included terms for payment schedules, quality control, and dispute resolution. Over two years, their relationship deteriorated due to conflicting interpretations of contractual obligations, payment delays, and disputes over product defects.

# General Facts  
NovaTech alleges that ZenCorp delayed payments for goods shipped under their supply contract, citing invoice discrepancies and quality issues. ZenCorp counters that NovaTech delivered substandard components, causing production halts and financial losses. The dispute centers on whether both parties adhered to the original agreement’s terms regarding payment timelines and defect liability.  

Key unresolved issues:  
1. Whether ZenCorp’s refusal to pay for a batch of microprocessors was justified due to quality defects.  
2. Validity of NovaTech’s claim for compensation for delayed shipments.  
3. Interpretation of the dispute resolution clause requiring mediation before litigation.  

Both parties agree that the original contract outlines payment schedules, quality control standards, and liability terms but disagree on their application. The case involves disagreements over compliance with contractual obligations and the validity of each party’s claims.
