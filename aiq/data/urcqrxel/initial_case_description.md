## **Background Information**  
NovaTech Solutions and ZenCorp Industries established a partnership in 2021 to supply advanced microprocessors for ZenCorp’s consumer electronics line. The agreement included terms for payment schedules, quality control, and dispute resolution. Over the past two years, the relationship has deteriorated due to conflicting interpretations of contractual obligations, delays in payments, and disputes over product defects.  

---

## **Case Description**  
NovaTech alleges that ZenCorp has systematically delayed payments for goods shipped under their supply contract, citing discrepancies in invoice amounts and quality issues. ZenCorp counters that NovaTech delivered substandard components, leading to production halts and financial losses. The dispute centers on whether the terms of the original agreement (specifically clauses regarding payment timelines and defect liability) were adhered to by both parties.  

Key unresolved issues include:  
1. Whether ZenCorp’s refusal to pay for a batch of microprocessors was justified due to quality defects.  
2. The validity of NovaTech’s claim for additional compensation for delayed shipments.  
3. The interpretation of the dispute resolution clause, which requires mediation before litigation.

## **Confidential Facts**  

### **Confidential Facts for the Requesting Party (NovaTech Solutions)**  
- ZenCorp has withheld over **$12 million** in payments for goods shipped in 2023, citing "non-conforming products," despite NovaTech’s evidence of compliance with quality standards.  
- NovaTech discovered that ZenCorp had subcontracted a third-party logistics firm to handle deliveries, which caused delays and miscommunication about shipment timelines.  
- A clause in the original contract allows for **partial payment** if defects are minor, but ZenCorp refused to acknowledge any such defects, leading to prolonged disputes.  
- NovaTech’s internal audits show that ZenCorp has a history of delaying payments to suppliers, particularly during periods of financial instability in Zentara.  

### **Confidential Facts for the Responding Party (ZenCorp Industries)**  
- NovaTech’s microprocessors were found to have **consistent manufacturing defects** affecting 15% of the delivered units, causing production delays and reputational harm to ZenCorp’s products.  
- ZenCorp’s procurement team claims that NovaTech failed to meet agreed-upon delivery deadlines in Q2 2023, resulting in a loss of **$8.5 million** in revenue for their flagship product line.  
- A review of the supply agreement revealed that the **payment terms were ambiguously worded**, allowing ZenCorp to withhold payments until all defects were resolved, as per Article 7.  
- ZenCorp’s financial records show that NovaTech was not the sole supplier for microprocessors; they sourced from three other vendors, reducing their reliance on NovaTech during disputes.
