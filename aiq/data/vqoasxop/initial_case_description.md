## Background Information on the Relationship Between the Parties  
Aurora Tech Industries and Virelia Components Ltd. entered into a long-term supply agreement in 2021 to provide high-quality electronic components for Aurora’s flagship consumer electronics line. The contract included strict delivery timelines, quality assurance clauses, and penalty provisions for breaches of performance. Over the past three years, the parties maintained a cooperative relationship, with Virelia delivering components on time and meeting quality standards. However, in late 2023, disputes arose over delayed shipments and alleged defects, leading to a breakdown in communication and the eventual termination of the contract.

## Case Description  
Aurora Tech Industries alleges that Vire, Components Ltd. failed to deliver critical electronic components on time, resulting in production delays and significant financial losses. Additionally, Aurora claims that 15% of the delivered goods were defective, violating the quality standards outlined in their supply agreement. Aurora seeks compensation for lost profits and penalties under the contract’s breach-of-contract clause.  

Virelia Components Ltd. counters that its failure to deliver on time was due to unforeseen shipping delays caused by a natural disaster in Virelia’s port infrastructure. The company also disputes Aurora’s claim of defects, asserting that the components met all quality standards and that the alleged defects were minor and attributable to Aurora’s improper handling during storage. Virelia argues that Aurora failed to provide timely notice of defects and improperly terminated the contract without renegotiating terms.

## Confidential Facts for Each Party  

### **Confidential Facts for the Requesting Party (Aurora Tech Industries)**  
- The defect rate in Virelia’s shipments exceeded the 5% threshold specified in their supply agreement, leading to a recall of 200 units of Aurora’s flagship product.  
- Aurora incurred an estimated loss of $12 million USD due to production delays and reputational damage from the product recall.  
- Virelia failed to deliver three critical components by the agreed deadline, causing Aurora to source replacements at a 35% premium cost.  
- Aurora attempted to resolve the issue via mediation in mid-2023 but was rebuffed by Virelia’s refusal to acknowledge the defect claims.  

### **Confidential Facts for the Responding Party (Virelia Components Ltd.)**  
- A Category 4 storm disrupted Virelia’s port operations from October 1–15, 2023, causing a two-week delay in shipping and forcing a reroute of cargo.  
- The alleged defects were traced to Aurora’s storage conditions, which exceeded the acceptable humidity levels specified in their quality agreement.  
- Virelia offered to replace defective components at no cost but was denied access to Aurora’s warehouse for inspection, citing proprietary data concerns.  
- Virelia claims that Aurora’s termination notice violated the 60-day notice period stipulated in the supply agreement and sought renegotiation of terms before terminating the contract.
