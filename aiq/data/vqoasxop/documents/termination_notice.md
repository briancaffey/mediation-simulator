## **Body of the Notice**  

### **1. Purpose of the Notice**  
This notice is issued by Aurora Tech Industries (hereinafter "Aurora") to Virelia Components Ltd. (hereinafter "Virelia") pursuant to Article 14 of the Supply Agreement dated April 5, 2021 (the "Agreement"). Aurora hereby formally terminates the Agreement effective immediately due to repeated and material breaches by Virelia of its contractual obligations under Sections 3 (Delivery Timelines), 6 (Quality Standards), and 10 (Penalties for Non-Compliance).  

---

### **2. Allegations of Breach**  
Aurora has conducted a thorough review of the Agreement’s terms and all relevant correspondence, including the technical report prepared by [Third-Party Technical Firm] on September 30, 2023. Based on this evidence, Aurora alleges the following breaches:  

#### **a) Non-Delivery of Critical Components**  
- Virelia failed to deliver 18 shipments of critical electronic components between January 2022 and June 2023, resulting in production delays exceeding 45 days.  
- These delays directly impacted Aurora’s ability to meet client deadlines, causing estimated financial losses of **AUR 2.3 million**.  
- Virelia’s claims that port infrastructure disruptions caused delays are inconsistent with the Agreement’s requirement for alternate shipping arrangements under Section 5 (Force Majeure).  

#### **b) Quality Defects in Delivered Goods**  
- **15% of all shipments received by Aurora were found to be defective**, violating the quality standards outlined in Section 6.2 of the Agreement.  
- The independent technical report confirms that these defects are attributable to manufacturing flaws, not storage conditions as Virelia contends.  
- Vire, as a supplier, is obligated under Section 6.4 to ensure components meet specifications; this obligation has been systematically breached.  

#### **c) Failure to Address Repeated Non-Compliance**  
- Despite multiple formal written notices (attached as Exhibit A), Virelia failed to rectify the above issues or provide satisfactory resolution by the stipulated deadlines under Section 10.3.  

---

### **3. Legal Basis for Termination**  
Aurora’s decision to terminate is grounded in the following contractual provisions:  
- **Section 14.1**: Right to terminate upon material breach of obligations.  
- **Section 14.2**: Notice period of 30 days from written notice of breach, which was provided on September 25, 2023.  
- **Section 14.3**: Entitlement to compensation for losses arising from non-performance, including penalties as outlined in Section 10.  

---

### **4. Demands and Instructions**  
Aurora demands the following actions within **7 days of receipt of this notice**:  
1. A full refund of all payments made for undelivered or defective components (per Section 10.2).  
2. Immediate cessation of all further shipments until compliance with quality and delivery standards is verified.  
3. Provision of a detailed corrective action plan to prevent recurrence of breaches.  

Failure to comply will result in Aurora pursuing all remedies under the Agreement, including:  
- Claiming damages for financial losses (estimated at **AUR 2.3 million**).  
- Seeking injunctive relief to prevent further non-compliance.  
- Pursuing arbitration under the Arbitration Clause of the Agreement (Section 17).  

---

### **5. Notice of Legal Action**  
Aurora reserves all rights under the Agreement and international trade laws, including but not limited to:  
- Filing a claim for breach of contract in the courts of Auroria.  
- Initiating arbitration proceedings as per Section 17 of the Agreement.  
- Pursuing compensation for reputational harm caused by Virelia’s non-performance.

## **Acknowledgment**  
Please confirm receipt of this notice via written reply or email by **October 22, 2023**. Failure to respond within this period will be deemed acceptance of Aurora’s termination and all associated remedies.  

Sincerely,  
**Alexandra Korr**  
Head of Procurement, Aurora Tech Industries
