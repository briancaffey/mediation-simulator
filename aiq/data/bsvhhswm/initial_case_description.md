## **Background Information on the Relationship**  
NordTech Industries and Solora Manufacturing entered into a supply contract in 2021 to provide high-quality electronic components for NordTech’s consumer electronics line. The agreement specified delivery timelines, quality standards, and penalties for non-compliance. Over the past two years, the parties have experienced tension over recurring issues with product defects, delayed shipments, and disputes over pricing adjustments.

## **Case Description**  
NordTech Industries alleges that Solora Manufacturing has repeatedly failed to deliver components meeting agreed-upon quality standards, resulting in production delays and significant financial losses. NordTech claims Solora’s defective parts caused a 20% drop in product sales during the first quarter of 2024.  

Solora Manufacturing counters that NordTech has unreasonably delayed payments for past shipments, violating the contract’s terms. Solora also asserts that NordTech failed to account for rising material costs in Soloria, leading to disputes over pricing adjustments and forcing them to cut corners on quality control. Both parties demand compensation and resolution of contractual obligations.
