### **Background Information**  
NovaTech Industries and Aurora Components established a supply partnership in 2021 to provide high-quality electronic components for NovaTech’s consumer electronics line. The agreement included delivery timelines, quality assurance protocols, and penalty clauses for non-compliance. Over the past two years, the parties experienced growing tensions due to delays in shipments, inconsistent product quality, and disputes over contractual obligations.

### **Case Description**  
NovaTech Industries alleges that Aurora Components failed to deliver critical components on time, causing production halts and significant financial losses. The requesting party claims Aurora violated the supply contract by:  
1. Delivering subpar materials that required rework, increasing manufacturing costs.  
2. Missing delivery deadlines by over 40% in the last six months.  
3. Refusing to resolve disputes without mediation, exacerbating operational disruptions.  

Aurora Components counters that NovaTech breached the contract by:  
1. Withholding payment for partially delivered goods due to quality concerns.  
2. Imposing penalties without proper documentation of defects.  
3. Failing to provide adequate notice of production changes, disrupting Aurora’s planning.  

The dispute now centers on whether Aurora’s delays were justified under force majeure clauses and whether NovaTech’s penalty claims are lawful.

### **Confidential Facts**  
#### **Confidential Facts for the Requesting Party (NovaTech Industries)**  
- **Internal logistics issues**: NovaTech recently merged with a smaller competitor, causing temporary disruptions in its supply chain management team.  
- **Penalty clause ambiguity**: The contract’s penalty clauses are unclear about whether partial deliveries qualify for reduced penalties, leading to disputes over payment terms.  
- **Alternative supplier engagement**: NovaTech explored alternative suppliers but faced delays due to Aurora’s dominance in the region’s component market.  
- **Financial impact**: Missed deliveries caused a 20% drop in quarterly revenue, with projected losses exceeding VC 5 million by year-end.  

#### **Confidential Facts for the Responding Party (Aurora Components)**  
- **Natural disaster disruption**: A severe storm in Aurora Dominion damaged key manufacturing facilities in early 2023, causing a 6-week production halt.  
- **Partial deliveries justified**: Aurora provided partial shipments during the crisis and offered discounts on remaining orders to mitigate NovaTech’s losses.  
- **Quality disputes unresolved**: NovaTech rejected multiple batches of components without providing documented evidence of defects, hindering resolution efforts.  
- **Force majeure clause**: Aurora claims the storm qualifies as a force majeure event under the contract, exempting them from penalties for delayed deliveries.

### **Key Legal Issues**  
1. Does Aurora’s claim of force majeure apply to its delivery delays?  
2. Are NovaTech’s penalty claims lawful given the ambiguity in the contract terms?  
3. What remedies are available for breaches of quality and delivery obligations under the supply agreement?  
4. Can the parties renegotiate terms to resolve disputes without terminating the partnership?  

This case presents a complex interplay of contractual interpretation, operational challenges, and mediation strategies, making it ideal for exploring dispute resolution in international business partnerships.
