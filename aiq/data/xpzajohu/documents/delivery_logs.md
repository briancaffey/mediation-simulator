## **6. Discrepancy Summary**  
### **NovaTech’s Allegations**:  
- Aurora failed to deliver 10% of ordered components on time (e.g., ORD-2648, ORD-2855).  
- Subpar quality caused production halts and rework costs exceeding $1.2M.  
- Third-party inspections confirmed "Critical" defects in multiple batches.  

### **Aurora’s Counterclaims**:  
- NovaTech withheld payment for partially delivered goods (e.g., ORD-2245, ORD-2310).  
- Penalty claims lack proper documentation of defect severity.  
- Force majeure events (e.g., equipment failure on Aug 8, 2022) justified delays.  

---

## **7. Conclusion**  
The Delivery Logs and Compliance Reports provide critical evidence to evaluate:  
1. Whether Aurora’s delays qualify as force majeure under the supply agreement.  
2. The validity of NovaTech’s penalty claims based on documented quality defects.  
3. The effectiveness of corrective actions taken by Aurora to address recurring issues.  

These records are essential for determining compliance with contractual obligations and resolving disputes over financial penalties and delivery timelines.
