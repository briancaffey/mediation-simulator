# Background  
NovaTech Industries and Aurora Components established a supply partnership in 2021 to provide electronic components for NovaTech’s consumer electronics line.

Over two years, tensions arose due to delays, inconsistent product quality, and disputes over contractual obligations.

# General Facts  
- **NovaTech alleges**: Aurora Components failed to deliver critical components on time, caused production halts, and provided subpar materials requiring rework.  
- **Aurora counters**: NovaTech withheld payment for partially delivered goods, imposed penalties without proper defect documentation, and failed to provide adequate notice of production changes.
