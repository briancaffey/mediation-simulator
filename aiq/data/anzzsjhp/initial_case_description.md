**Background Information:**

NovaSpire Inc. and HelixCorp Ltd. formed a strategic partnership in 2018 to co-develop and market a revolutionary new material for the tech industry, dubbed "SmartWeave." The partnership was hailed as a game-changer, with both companies contributing their expertise and resources to bring the product to market. Jamie Zhang, CEO of NovaSpire, and Taylor Kim, CEO of HelixCorp, had a close working relationship and were instrumental in driving the partnership forward.

**Case Description:**

The partnership between NovaSpire and HelixCorp has been plagued by disagreements over intellectual property rights, revenue sharing, and control of the SmartWeave project. NovaSpire claims that HelixCorp has been secretly developing a competing product, "WeaveX," which infringes on NovaSpire's patents and undermines the partnership. HelixCorp denies these allegations, stating that WeaveX is a distinct product that does not infringe on NovaSpire's IP. The dispute has led to a breakdown in communication and cooperation between the two companies, putting the entire SmartWeave project at risk.
