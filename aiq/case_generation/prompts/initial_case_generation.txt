The case topic should be a dispute between two parties over a business relationship. Possible
examples of the case topics could be:
- High-Tech Partnership Dispute
- International Supply Contract Issue
- Intellectual Property Licensing Conflict
- Family Business Split over inherited business
- Construction Project Dispute

The case information should include the following:
- Case Name
- Requesting and responding parties
-- Fictional, gender-neutral names of the individuals involved
-- Fictional names of the organizations involved with fictional country names (DO NOT USE REAL COUNTRY NAMES) and fictional currencies
-- Background information on the relationship between the parties
- Case description
- Related documents
-- Name of the document
-- Type of document
-- filename with a .md extension
-- Document description
- Confidential facts for each party (3 to 4 bullet points per party)
-- Confidential facts for the requesting party
-- Confidential facts for the responding party

The confidential facts should be unique, interesting, representative of actual business
scenarios, balanced and should make for an excellent case for use in a law school mediation
tournament.
